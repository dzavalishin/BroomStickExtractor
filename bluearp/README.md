# BroomStick Bass patterns for BlueArp

All the preset banks here contain patterns that mostly copy corresponding BroomStick Bass presets.

## Differences:

 * All patterns are monophonic
 * Articulation switches (legato/staccato/slide) are lost
 * All notes are exactly 1/16
 * No mod wheel position


## Programs in banks

All banks contain 3 groups of 8 programs. First group is for major chord,
2nd for major 7th, third is minor. Sometimes there's no difference (if
pattern uses just root and octave notes, it can be used over any chord
you like). Sometimes minor patterns differ a lot.

Each group has 8 patterns from the simplest one to most detailed and full.

## Kudos

This work wouldn't be possible without help from Oleg Mikheev aka Graywolf. Thank you!

And, of course, thanx and respect to Sven Bornemark and his colleagues for BroomStick Bass.
