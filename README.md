# Blue Arp convertor

Convert MIDI patterns to BlueArp patterns. 

Made specially to process Broomstick Bass patterns, 
but supposedly will convert any monophonic MIDI 
pattern to BlueArp preset.

NB! Breaks MIDI pattern in 8 parts before conversion.
It is supposed that there are 8 variations of pattern per file.

Leave issue if you fail converting something valuable, I'll try to help.
